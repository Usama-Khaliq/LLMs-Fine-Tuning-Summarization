    "text=\"Extreme weather is becoming more frequent and more intense in many places because of climate change Scientists say this will continue whilst humans keep releasing planetwarming greenhouse gases Here are four ways climate change is linked to extreme weather 1 Hotter longer heatwaves Even a small increase to average temperatures makes a big difference This is because the whole distribution of daily temperatures shifts to warmer levels making hotter days more likely and more extreme A small shift makes a big difference A line chart showing how small changes in the climate increases the probability of more hot weather and more extreme weather Scientists use computer simulations to judge whether extreme weather events have been made more likely by warming caused by humans For example a recordbreaking heatwave across Spain Portugal and northwest Africa in April was made at least 100 times more likely by climate change according to the World Weather Attribution network WWA Its too early to say for certain whether the ongoing July 2023 heatwaves across parts of Europe southwest US and China have been made significantly more likely by climate change But experts say these types of events are consistent with what is expected in a warming world particularly when combined with natural weather patterns like high pressure systems and El Nio In the UK temperatures topped 40C for the first time on record in July 2022 This would have been extremely unlikely without climate change the WWA says Why is it so hot in the UK Is the UK getting hotter Heatwaves are also becoming longer and more intense including in the UK This can happen through heat domes an area of high pressure where hot air is pushed down and trapped in place causing temperatures to soar over large areas One theory suggests higher temperatures in the Arctic which has warmed more than four times faster than the global average are causing strong winds called the jet stream to slow and increasing the likelihood of heat domes A graphic showing how heat domes are formed 1 A mass of warm air builds up in still and dry summer conditions 2 High pressure in the atmosphere pressures the warm air down 3 The air is compressed and gets even hotter Life at 50 degrees 2 Longer droughts Linking climate change and individual droughts can be difficult The availability of water is not just down to temperature and rainfall But longer and more intense heatwaves can worsen droughts by drying out soils The air above then warms up faster leading to more intense heat Demand for water from humans and farming in hot weather puts even more stress on the water supply In parts of East Africa an ongoing drought has left more than 20 million people at risk of being dangerously short of food Climate change made this drought more than 100 times more likely according to the WWA A man walks in front of a sandstorm in Dollow southwest Somalia People from across Gedo in Somalia have been displaced due to drought 14 April 2022 IMAGE SOURCEGETTY IMAGES Image caption Drought in Somalia the country has suffered five failed rainy seasons in a row 3 More fuel for wildfires Wildfires happen naturally in many parts of the world Its difficult to know if climate change has caused a wildfire because other factors like changes to land use can be involved Some regions such as the western US have seen an increase in the area burnt by wildfires but global wildfire trends are complex However scientists say climate change is making the weather conditions needed for wildfires more likely Extreme and longlasting heat draws more and more moisture out of the ground and vegetation Firefighters and police evacuate a person in a wheelchair after a forest fire approached his house in Ninhue uble Region in Chile on February 10 2023 Forest fires raged for more than a week in southcentral Chile leaving at least 24 people dead IMAGE SOURCEJAVIER TORRESAFP Image caption Dozens of people died and were evacuated in Chile as wildfires burned across the country These tinderdry conditions provide fuel for fires which can spread at an incredible speed particularly if winds are strong Alberta in Canada has seen unprecedented wildfires forcing nearly 30000 people to leave their homes This follows severe wildfires in Chile and Australia earlier in 2023 Scientists expect wildfires to become more frequent and intense in future due to the combined effects of land use and climate change Then and now The burning issue of wildfires How do wildfires start 4 More extreme rain The warmer it becomes the more moisture the atmosphere can hold This results in more droplets and heavier rainfall sometimes in a shorter space of time and over a smaller area A chart showing how record temperatures cause extreme rainfall 1 More heat from sun causes greater evaporation 2 More moisture forms clouds 3 Heavier rain In 2022 Pakistan experienced its wettest July and August on record triggering devastating floods affecting more than 33 million people It is likely that climate change played a role according to the WWA but natural weather patterns like the monsoon may have been involved too How do El Nio and La Nia change the weather Extreme rainfall and flooding has also hit other regions including West Africa between May and October 2022 and New Zealand in February 2023 Scientists cannot say for certain that they were caused by climate change but the floods are consistent with the changes they expect in a warming world\""
